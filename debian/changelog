    as I had hoped
  * d/tests: mark test-extensions.sh to only be run in virtual machines,
    in the hope that when ci.debian.net gets a qemu runner, it will
    work there

    with cleanup in response to the container's main process (which
    exits first) shutting down

  * d/p/debian/Try-gtk-3.0-version-of-the-icon-cache-utility-first.patch:
    bring back compatibility with gtk-update-icon-cache-3.0, for backports

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Sat, 25 Jun 2016 12:03:06 +0100

flatpak (0.6.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

      drop, applied upstream
    - update symbols file for new ABI
  * d/p/Link-libselinux-into-bwrap-if-enabled-with-LDADD-not-LDFL.patch:

  * d/tests/gnome-desktop-testing: correctly report failures
  * d/tests/control: depend on ostree, used to export a Flatpak repository

flatpak (0.6.4-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    - d/p/Correctly-handle-with-privileged-group.patch: drop, no longer
      necessary
    - adjust packaging for new name and location of flatpak-bwrap
    - adjust packaging for new location of installed-tests
  * Unconditionally recommend gtk-update-icon-cache now that it's in
    testing
    - d/p/Try-gtk-3.0-version-of-the-icon-cache-utility-first.patch:
        drop, no longer necessary
  * d/control: update Homepage
  * d/copyright: update Source
  * tests: depend on attr, for setfattr, to get better test coverage
    (still skipped if /var/tmp on the testbed does not support xattrs)
  * d/p/flatpak-run-don-t-fail-if-there-are-no-system-fonts.patch:
    don't fail uses of flatpak-run or the builder test if the system
    has no fonts
  * debian/org.freedesktop.Flatpak.pkla: add an equivalent of the
    upstream JavaScript polkit rules (used by polkit >= 0.106),
    for use with polkit 0.105 as shipped in Debian. This allows members
    of group 'sudo' to install apps and runtimes into the system-wide
    location, from any remote that was previously added/trusted by a
    privileged user, without re-authenticating. (Closes: #825766)

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Sun, 05 Jun 2016 15:19:00 +0100

flatpak (0.6.2-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    - d/p/Treat-members-of-sudo-group-as-privileged.patch: drop,
      superseded by new --with-privileged-group option
    - d/p/Skip-tests-that-make-a-repository-if-var-tmp-lacks-user-x.patch:
      drop, merged upstream
  * Use new --with-privileged-group option to make "sudo" group privileged
    - d/p/Correctly-handle-with-privileged-group.patch: add post-release
      patch from upstream to make it work
    - drop hack to make admin group privileged on Ubuntu, they started to
      phase out that group in 2012
  * Build-depend on libdw-dev from src:elfutils instead of libdwarf-dev.
    Both provide dwarf.h, which is all we really need; libdw-dev is
    the one that is used in various important packages, including systemd.
    We also require src:elfutils anyway, for libelf-dev. (Closes: #825191)
  * debian/upstream/signing-key.asc: add
  * debian/gbp.conf: automatically merge upstream tag into imported source

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Tue, 24 May 2016 20:24:48 +0100

flatpak (0.6.1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    - drop patches to bubblewrap, included in the submodule upstream
  * d/p/Try-gtk-3.0-version-of-the-icon-cache-utility-first.patch:
    add missing space between the tool's name and its --quiet argument
  * d/p/Treat-members-of-sudo-group-as-privileged.patch:
    use sudo, not wheel, as the group of administrative users
    - d/rules: alter the polkit policy on Ubuntu derivatives to treat
      the admin group as equivalent to sudo
  * d/rules: don't install bwrap setuid on Ubuntu. Ubuntu enables
    unprivileged user namespaces by default. (Closes: #825090)
  * d/p/Skip-tests-that-make-a-repository-if-var-tmp-lacks-user-x.patch:
    skip several tests if we can run bwrap, but cannot write extended
    attributes in /var/tmp, for example on an Ubuntu live system
  * Use dh_girepository to get correct ${gir:Depends}
  * Prefer gtk-update-icon-cache as provider of the binary of the same
    name, but still accept libgtk-3-bin for now, to be nice to backports

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Mon, 23 May 2016 23:06:50 +0100

flatpak (0.6.0-3) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Build-depend on procps, for /bin/kill (used in the tests).
    This fixes FTBFS in a more up-to-date buildd schroot.

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Sun, 22 May 2016 14:19:12 +0100

flatpak (0.6.0-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * debian/flatpak.postinst: initialize /var/lib/flatpak/repo
    as requested by upstream
  * debian/flatpak.postrm: remove /var/lib/flatpak/repo on purge
  * Use dh-systemd to restart flatpak-system-helper on upgrades
  * debian/tests/control: flatpak-builder test requires make
  * Add patches from bubblewrap bug #71 to the embedded copy of bwrap,
    fixing flatpak-builder on the normal configuration of Debian kernels
  * Change patch for gtk-update-icon-cache-3.0 to fall back to
    gtk-update-icon-cache. This means it will still work when the
    Debian-specific gtk-update-icon-cache-3.0 name is dropped.

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Sat, 21 May 2016 22:57:49 +0100

flatpak (0.6.0-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Rename package from xdg-app to flatpak, following upstream rename
  * New upstream release
    - Remove patches, applied upstream
    - Add new build-dependency on libpolkit-gobject-1-dev
  * libflatpak-dev: depend on libflatpak0, not flatpak (Closes: #823328)
  * debian/copyright: update
  * Install bwrap (bubblewrap) helper tool setuid by default, so that
    the package works without further configuration (Closes: #823535)
    - note that an unreleased snapshot of bwrap is also available as
      src:bubblewrap; for now this package uses its bundled submodule,
      until we get a better idea of how closely these packages will
      need to track each other
  * Add autopkgtests for as-installed testing
  * Build-depend on dbus-x11: the tests explicitly use dbus-launch

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Wed, 04 May 2016 09:36:05 +0100

xdg-app (0.5.2-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * debian/patches/install-Only-set-current-for-apps-not-for-runtimes.patch:
    remove, no longer necessary (and wasn't applied)
  * debian/gbp.conf: use DEP-14 branch names
  * Correct ITP bug number in previous changelog entry (was #697477,
    should have been #813308)
  * Don't build-depend on fuse. The test that uses fuse appears to fail on
    buildds, possibly because the kernel module is blacklisted; it should
    automatically be skipped when fuse isn't installed.
  * debian/gbp.conf: disable numbered patches, to reduce diff noise when
    they get applied upstream
  * d/p/session-helper-connect-the-D-Bus-and-systemd-services.patch:
    link the D-Bus session service to the systemd user service
  * Standards-Version: 3.9.8 (no changes needed)

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Apr 2016 09:06:11 +0100

xdg-app (0.5.0-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Prepare package for Debian (Closes: #813308)
  * Set the Utopia Maintenance Team as maintainer, with myself and
    Matthias Klumpp as uploaders
  * Add Vcs-Git, Vcs-Browser (in collab-maint git)
  * Remove unnecessary use of dh-exec
  * Remove -dbg package, rely on automatic dbgsym packages instead
  * debian/.gitignore: add
  * debian/copyright: fill in all copyright holders
  * Normalize packaging via `wrap-and-sort -abst`
  * Adjust Section for the packages
  * Run the tests with VERBOSE=1
  * Install the new systemd user services
  * Run dh_install with --fail-missing to catch mistakes
  * Rename libxdgapp to the correct libxdg-app0 corresponding to
    libxdg-app.so.0
  * Rename libxdgapp-dev to libxdg-app-dev for consistency
  * Stop disabling the test that relies on FUSE; it is now correctly
    skipped if appropriate
  * Re-enable gtk-doc and add a libxdg-app-doc package
  * Add libxdg-app0.symbols
  * Add missing development dependencies
  * Set ${libexecdir} to /usr/lib/xdg-app, to avoid the toolchain getting
    confused by PIE executables in ${libexecdir} and treating them as
    incorrectly-named shared libraries
  * xdg-app-builder: reduce non-mandatory build tools to Recommends
  * xdg-app-builder: do not depend on tar, which is Essential
  * Fill in better values for Description
  * Depend on libpam-systemd (i.e. a working systemd-logind),
    because xdg-app currently relies on systemd to put user processes
    in cgroups
  * Run tests once via check-TESTS, but do not run them a second time
    via gtester, which fails because all test-cases in one test might
    be skipped
  * debian/control: document how to enable user namespaces
  * Only build for Linux: this package is specifically not portable
